# Cupcake

> A multi-screen cupcake ordering app exploring navigation in Android

An Android application that simulates a cupcake ordering flow with multiple screens. Built as part of the **Android Basics with Compose** curriculum to learn app navigation and state management across screens.

## 🧁 About

**Cupcake** is a learning project that demonstrates how to build a multi-screen Android app with proper navigation flow. Users can select cupcake quantities, choose flavors, pick pickup dates, and review their order before sharing — all while maintaining state across different screens.

This project is part of the **#AndroidBasics** learning path.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

This project taught me:

- **Navigation Component**: Managing multi-screen flows in Android
- **ViewModel**: Sharing data across multiple screens
- **State Management**: Maintaining order state throughout the app
- **Jetpack Compose Navigation**: Building navigation graphs declaratively
- **Back Stack Management**: Handling the back button properly
- **Data Flow**: Passing information between composables

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose
- **Architecture**: ViewModel
- **Navigation**: Jetpack Compose Navigation
- **Build System**: Gradle (Kotlin DSL)
